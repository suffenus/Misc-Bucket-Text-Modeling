Resulting internal price changes   destroy  value   domestic currency  money. 
  area under consideration  small    ratio  tradable  non-tradable goods  large   prices   former  fairly well fixed   outside currency, then  monetary implications  pegging  do�mestic currency   non-tradable goods   satisfactory.  class  non-tradable goods   constitute typical bundle  economic goods.  class  importables   more representative,  currency pegged  maintain  value  terms  importables  small area   higher liquidity value   pegged   domestically produced non�tradable goods. , pegging currency  small area  maintain  value  terms  representative bundle  imports  large outside area  virtually  same thing  pegging    outside currency. Alterna�tively,    number  small areas  trade extensively   ,   pegs  currency  representative bundle  imports, then  currency   pegged   others.  maintain  liquidity value  individual currencies  small areas, fixed exchange-rate system  nec�essary.  addition, capital movements  small areas  more needed  promote efficient economic specialization  growth  free capital move�ments  large, economically developed areas. Contractual arrangements   movements  greatly facilitated  common currency.  arguments give us some insight  why    fifty states   United States   efficiently issue  own currency, aside   in�convenience  money changing.
