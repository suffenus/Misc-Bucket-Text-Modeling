 empirical analysis exploits  presence  contractual menu. Consumers  choose   .at-rate contracts� monthly contract  annual contract�and pay-per�visit option.  monthly contract  automati�cally renewed  month  month until  consumer cancels.  annual contract, instead, expires  12 months unless  consumer explicitly renews .  variation   per�usage pricing    renewal procedures allows us  identify several puzzling features  consumer behavior.
