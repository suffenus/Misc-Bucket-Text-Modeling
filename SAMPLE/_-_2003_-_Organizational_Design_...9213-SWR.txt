  paper, de Fontenay  Gans recon�sider  bargaining setting  introducing outside pool  identically productive employ�ees,   whom   immediately brought inside  firm  produce  negotiations  current worker break down.  interesting   results, de Fontenay  Gans find   external pool generates underemploy�ment rather  overemployment.  intuition    explained quite clearly   paper.  outside replacement workers   brought   firm immediately   pro�ductively equivalent  internal employees,  confer  same bargaining benefits  workers   hired  brought inside  firm-either way   serve  replace quitting worker.    longer bargaining benefit  overemployment. Moreover,   external pool  finite, employees  still ex�ercise some hold-up power   firm  capture rents  employee separation brings  firm closer  running   replace�

wages  exceed  reservation wage,  firm  actually underhire relative  neo�classical (nonbargaining firm)  equates mar�ginal output   reservation wage.
