Therefore,   nature   date-1 self-control problem (value  prob�ability distribution  �, returns  effort) makes  more  concern   low type    high , meaning   severity  moderate,   net efficiency gain   malleabil�ity  beliefs (. < 1)   enhancement   low types� dignity   allows.   self�control problem  harder, , meaning   affects  high types more often   low ones,   again net social loss.
