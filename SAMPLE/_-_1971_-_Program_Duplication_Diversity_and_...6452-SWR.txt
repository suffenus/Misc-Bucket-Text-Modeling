Shortly  completion   explor�atory research, . Land Associates, under commission   National Association  Broadcasters, prepared Index  Di�versity based  similar 20-point cod�ing  logs  188 TV stations located  sample  59 markets covered  TV Guide   week  April 27, 1968. (See

wherein "   rank (1-20)   par�ticular market   program classifica�tion, determined  ordering categories according  total broadcast time devoted   ( sample week);     number  half-hours  programming time devoted   category."   conceived, low values   Index  indicate concentration towards   popular program types,  high values greater equality  time    popu�lar types  greater interest  minority taste groups.

Though valuable step forward,  approach too  important drawbacks. Conceivably low diversity   mea�sured might  consistent  substantial viewer choices  hour-by-hour basis. Suppose   station  two-station market carries  identical number  30�minute units  four program types.
