Experiments  Decentralized Mechanism  Public Good Decisions

Public goods theory,  articulated  Paul Samuelson (1954), Mancur Olson,   others,  maintained   distinguish�ing characteristic  nonexcludability, inher�ent  public goods, implies  impossibility  optimal public good provision  de�centralized (voluntary) mechanisms.      excluded   benefits   public good,   incentive  "free ride";  , contribute    marginal valuation   cost   public good. Consequently, public goods theory  suggested  hypotheses.

. Empirical Tests  Public Goods Theory 
   casual evidence  suggest  mechanisms exist   voluntary provision  public goods. Thousands  churches, music halls, libraries, scientific laboratories, art museums, theatres,    facilities   financed  voluntary contributions  fund drives con�ducted  private societies.   observa�tions  dismissed  evidence contrary  HI   grounds    instances  atypical altruism, then   serious question    public goods theory consists   refutable hypotheses.  ob�servations contrary  theory    ruled    basis  special explana�tions  part   original theory, then   indeed dealing   Galbraithian systems  belief,   scientific proposi�tions.

 more substantive objection   ob�servations  successful private society fund drives might    represent "small" groups, whereas  public good problem  "large" group problem.  regardless   size   finite group,   always imagine larger collective,  conclude   hypothesis    disproven. Even  collective  size    incentive  free ride,  underprovide  joint outcome. Consequently,  size  claimed   critical parameter  public goods theory,  nature   effect   well specified  examining  ob�servations.  suppose  grant  action  private societies   compelling evi�dence rejecting HI;  although  dis�tinction  small  large   pre�cise, private societies  "clearly" too small  represent valid test  HI. Then   look  examples  voluntary action  larger collectives.  example  voting  national elections, , unlike Australia,   yet required  law   United States.  problem  voting  often described  public goods problem:   individual voter    per�ceivable effect   common outcome,    act  voting involves some cost (going   polls, reading  mark�ing  ballot, etc.),  follows, allegedly,    observe little   voting activ�ity.  fact, "remarkably large" numbers  people vote.   judged   evidence contrary  HI  political economists? ,   "paradox,"    great litera�ture   paradox  voting   distinguished contributions (see Gordon Tullock; George Stigler; . Ferejohn  . Fiorina). Once again, cherished belief re�mains unshaken,   observation  explained anecdotally. 
  arguing  HI  disproved   fact  people vote,   observation  private societies  sometimes success�ful  building-fund drives;  arguing  clearer standards  evidence.  field observations  clearly inconsistent   strong free rider hypothesis; large num�bers  people vote,  public goods   provided  private societies.     know   know  field observation   optimal quantity   given public good   provided. Some fund drives succeed,   facility  built; others fail.  terms  optimality,  some   latter  succeeded,   some   former  provided larger  better facilities?   know   optimal without independent in�formation  individual valuations.

. Laboratory Experiments 
  previous experimental research using partial equilibrium design ( in�come effects),  found  collectives com�posed  four, five,  eight members  able,   replications,  reach agree�ment  produce optimal  near optimal amounts  public good under  version   Groves-Ledyard mechanism   auction mechanism (see  1979 paper). , under  Lindahl mecha�nism  (unlike  Groves-Ledyard  auction mechanism)   incentive com�patible (.., Pareto optimal allocations     set  points   Nash equilibria),  found  experimental collec�tives did  worse; specifically,   replications none   public good  produced,   , positive quantity equal  one-half  optimum  pro�vided. ,  Lindahl mechanism experimental results provided evidence  support   '   results    incentive-compatible mechanisms sup�port Hp  demonstrating  operational procedures exist   solution   free rider problem.

. Field Experiments 
Beginning  1974, approximately 150 sta�tion managers   American network  noncommercial television stations  used computer-based decentralized mechanism called  Station Program Cooperative (SPC)  produce  allocate substantial portion (nearly half   1974-75 season)   programs broadcast   stations.  SPC procedure uses series    twelve trials,   selected  25  38 programs  menus   200     operating seasons. 
Unlike  laboratory experiments re�ported above,   field experiment re�ported below,  SPC (inefficiently,  the�ory) selectively excludes members    contribute  share  cost  given program.   trial,  station agent votes "yes"  ""   program, based   cost share allocated     previous trial.    trial initiali�zation procedure  followed.  present,  cost borne  station   program   simply

Peter Bohm  reported  results

 summary,  empirical evidence  laboratory experiments, controlled field experiments,  actual field experience (SPC) overwhelmingly supports Hp.     true  incentive-compatible pub�lic good mechanisms  possible,    exist operational forms   mech�anisms;    true   mechanisms  fairly easy  invent,    com�plicated  difficult  understand,    easy  computerize  large-scale decisions. Furthermore,   some evi�dence (see Marwell  Ames)  suggest   problem  free riding   severe  fact, pretty weak-even    strong  fairly obvious incentives  withhold contributions  public good.   mechanisms   incentive com�patible, perhaps  undercurrent  non�free-rider behavior  some agents helps  offset  effect  strategic manipulation (always potentially present)   agents.
