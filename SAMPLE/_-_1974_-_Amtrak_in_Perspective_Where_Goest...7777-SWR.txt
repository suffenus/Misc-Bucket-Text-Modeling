 October 1973 President Nixon signed  Amtrak Improvement Act providing furtding  1974.  addition, ;  legislation contained  provisions  make Amtrak' search  solvency even more difficult  under  original 1970 ground rules. ,  existing routes  frozen  another year. , new experimental route,   selected   Secretary  Transportation,    of�fered   public  -year.

Fast, frequent, relatively worry-free ser�vice provides feasible alternative  high�way  air transport.    case  commuter transit, long-run subsidy  corridor operations  justified        public  pay  pro�vide alternative means  displaced rail patrons.
