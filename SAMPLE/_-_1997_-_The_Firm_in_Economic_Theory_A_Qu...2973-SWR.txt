  costs  acquiring price information, ne�gotiating,  exchanging.  interpret Coase  manner consistent   objectives,  costs   interpreted     activity undertaken  use  price sys�tem. Analogously, management cost   interpreted     activity undertaken  manage consciously  use  resources.  cost  telephone call   cost  using  market  some circumstances ,  others, cost  managing;    cost  transacting   contracting. Negotiating  purchase good  another firm gives rise  cost  using  price system; negotiating  set  limits ofemployee work assignments gives rise  cost  managing.  inter�pretation  consistent  contemporary dis�cussions  governance  contracting,   avoid  confusion  accompanies terms     "transacting,"  henceforth refer  PSC  MSC   costs, respec�tively,  using price system   using management system. 
  perfect-competition model, PSC  MSC   zero.    prices, goods,  technology   freely known. Therefore,  comparison  Coase makes  judging  relative importance  managed  price-guided resource allocation   relevant  firms  markets   perfect�competition model. Yet,   model,   firms  markets.  complement   rather ,    views  Coase  contemporary theory, competing   . Firms,  sole producers  goods  services  sale  others, require conceptual "places" (.., markets)   entitlements   goods  services  exchanged,  even  service  exchanging  produced  firms. Markets reveal exchange opportunities    produce goods  services;    substitute  firms   respect.  im�plicit substitute   firm   theory  self-sufficient production. 
Coase seeks  bright line  separates managed coordination  price-guided co�ordination. Neoclassical theory,

search  analogous bright line,  seek   separates production  others  self-sufficient production,   more conventional terminology,   sepa�r;ltes specialization  self-sufficiency.  relative importance   turns   ad�vantages  come  scale economies, :conomies  repetitive task performance, comparative advantage,   . 
   lets PSC  positive,  neo�classical comparison responds quite differ�ently   way Coase' comparison responds. Neoclassical theory  view PSC olS impediment  specialization   cause  diminution   importance   economy.  means diminution   im�portance  firms   price system (..,  market).

Coase' view,  contemporary theory' ,    opposite  .

Positive PSC,    hand, increases  relative impor�tance  firms (..,  managed coordination). lhese conclusions clash    neo�c'lassical theory  managed coordina�tion increases   vertical depth   firm increases.  firm manages  production  more    uses.      ac�companied  horizontal shrinkage   size   firm.   normally happen  PSC Increases.  horizontal shrinkage means  specialized production  others,       interpreted  neoclassical theory  diminution   importance  firms.    .

,   view  neoclassical theory, self-direction  response  prices   create self-sufficiency,    non-firm. Self-sufficiency means production obtained  ' own resources   offered  others , therefore,  undertaken  re�sponse  price signals.  one-person firm entails  management   activities  oth�ers,    non-firm  Coase  contem�porary theory,   one-person production unit (' sell  others.      fullest possible extent  PSC  zero,     ,  qualifies  firm   view  neo�claSSical theory.

 different views    discussing  directed toward understanding different phenomena. Neoclassical theory  focused  specialization,   managed coordination. Coase' theory  focused  managed coor�dination,   specialization. Contemporary theory  still different emphasis.  con�cern  mainly  agency problems, ,   more closely related  Coase' theory   neoclassical theory   focus   op�timal mixtures  market-based incentives  mandgement-based controls. Nonetheless,   propositions concerning  exis�tenct:  importance  firms  firm-like contracts.  regard   propositions,  neoclassical view seems     superior   views  Coase  contemporary theory. 
. Abandoning  Presumptions  Neoclassical Theory 
 contemporary theorizing  firms shares  weakness  Coase' views   existence  importance  finns,   nonetheless im�proved knowledge  institutional arrangements   respects.    done  rejecting  assumptions used  neoclassical theory   core model   competitive firm: () mar�kets function freely, () prices  technology  known   interested parties,  () owners  effective  controlling  use   assets.   place, contemporary theory substitutes positive information cost.  cre�ates productive role  management  none exists  neoclassical theory.  firm  neoclassical theory reflects  imperatives ofthe price system,    management;   price system works well, resources  allocated well. Imperfect information,  contrast, makes  judgment  managers  owners source  productivity enhancement.  main source  management' productivity  contemporary theory     response  agency prob�lems. Shirking, opportunism,  reputation  brought   fore. Understanding  ,   business practices responding  ,  improved rapidly   last quarter century.   properly source  pride     worked   topics. 
,  focus   effort  led   neglect  information problems    involve agency relationships.   as�sociated  planning  world    future  highly uncertain,   include problems  product choice, investment  marketing policies,  scope  operations. Agency problems often intertwine      central  . Neglect   class  problems  unfortunate.  solu�tions offer different explanations  business practices   derived  agency re�lationships.  agency problems   primary guide  understanding vertical inte�gration? Perhaps,  consider,  example,  role  "expertise." Specialization  pro�ductive  regard  acquiring knowledge. Forsaking reliance  specialized body  knowledge  using multiple kinds  knowledge instead raises  cost  unit  knowledge acquired.  manufacturer  commercial aircraft possesses specialized knowledge    extended  little cost   business  maintaining older aircraft. Vertical integration    businesses , therefore, practical possibility. Vertical in�tegration  aircraft manufacturing  airline transportation,    hand,  more dif�ficult. Effective vending  airline transporta�tion   general public requires operational  marketing know-how  normally part   knowledge needed  manufacture aircraft.  difficulty  poses   depend  agency problems.   readily seen  sup�posing   firm comprises  single per�son,   composed   persons,  supposing    engages  opportunistic behavior. Agency problems  absent,   advantages  avoiding operations requiring different kinds  knowledge remain. 
 focus  agency relationships   led  neglect  some useful neoclassical the�orizing.  successive-monopoly problem, price discrimination,  price controls,  ex�amples, offer motives  vertical integration  involving agency problems.  more gen�eral importance  business organization,   neglect   impact  prices themselves.  firm  long survive management  per�sists  using capital-intensive methods  pro�duction   monitoring behavior   price  capital keeps rising relative   price  labor.     variation  manage�ment techniques  contractual form  ex�plained  agency problems     relative prices?  work  contemporary theorists suggests   believe agency problems   important source  variation,   wonder    .
