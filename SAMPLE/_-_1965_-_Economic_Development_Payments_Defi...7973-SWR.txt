Economic Development, Payments Deficit,  Payments Restriction.  . . CHATTERJEE. Geneva: Librarie . Droz., 1963. . 168.  20. 
 book discusses  following question:  country  interested  economic development,   better off  pursue international economic policy  free convertibility-currency convertibility  fixed exchange rates  relatively free trade-or policy  restriction-exchange control  quantitative controls  imports. Several themes appear  different contexts throughout  book. Convertibility fosters competition  therefore efficien�cy,  restriction fosters monopoly,   monopoly profits  encour�age investment. Convertibility subjects  domestic economy  shocks origi�nating abroad,  restriction insulates  economy  foreign shocks  produces more certain results. Chapter 2, "Convertibility School vs. Re�strictionist School," discusses  points plus number  points  lesser importance. 
Chapter 3, "Conditions  Convertibility," stresses  importance  domestic monetary stability  investment  international reserves   maintenance  convertibility. Succeeding chapters discuss  concept  structural disequilibrium,   author feels   vague    practi�cally useless,   proposition  inflation promotes growth, proposi�tion   author regards  skepticism.  chapter  balanced growth (Chapter 6) concludes   concept  essentially vague.  bal�anced growth means  production  follow  growth  demand  specific consumer goods, then  concept  balanced growth  added noth�ing  existing theory   production  profitable;  domestic production  certain consumer goods   profitable, then  plea  balanced growth  plea   misallocation  resources. Furthermore, attempt  bal�ance domestic demand  every good  domestic production   lead   closure   economy. 
Problems connected  terms-of-trade losses  discussed  Chapter 7.  statistical problems  measuring  elasticities  foreign trade  dis�cussed  well   significance   deterioration   terms  trade   occur. terms-of-trade loss  often  unavoidable result  shift   foreign demand  exports   domestic growth  increases  output  export industries.  terms  trade   good guide   allocation  resources. Export production   expanded  needed goods   obtained more cheaply through trade  through domestic production;  terms-of-trade loss resulting  higher exports  irrele�vant.
