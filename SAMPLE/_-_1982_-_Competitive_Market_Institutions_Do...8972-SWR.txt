Bid-Offer Process (PQ) 
  PLATO sealed bid-offer auction mechanism, PQ, uses  following proce�dure:   trading period  buyer sub�mits  bid price,  corresponding max�imum quantity /  willing  buy   price  . Similarly,  seller sub�mits  offer price  corresponding maximum quantity /  willing  sell   price  more. Next,  bids  ordered  highest  lowest,  bid price;  offers  ordered  lowest  highest,  offer price.   bids (offers)  tied,   entered  (chronologically)  priority. Then selection algorithm gener�ates single market-clearing price.5 ex�ample actually used   PLATO instruc�tions   bid-offer auction mechanism  shown   2.
