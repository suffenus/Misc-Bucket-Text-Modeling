Proximity  Production Fragmentation� 
 Robert . Johnson  Guillermo Noguera* 
Recent decades  seen acceleration  cross-border production fragmentation, defined  specialization across vertically linked stages   production process.  practice,  means  countries import intermediate inputs, com�bine  inputs  domestic value added,  reexport  combined product   final good   input  later production stages. 
 fragmented production processes  commonly referred   �global� produc�tion chains. Anecdotes suggest, ,     chains might  more accurately described  �local� production chains,   include geographically proximate coun�tries.  example, auto parts trade  concen�trated  North America,  production  assembly  electronic components occurs  Asia.   good reason, too: proximity conserves  trade costs   incurred based   distance gross shipments travel  production stages. Further, regional trade inte�gration initiatives  lowered trade barriers preferentially  nearby countries. 
Building   logic,  might expect  see increases  production fragmentation  time concentrated  proximate trading partners.   turn implies  fragmentation   driving localization  trade  time.   paper,  present evidence supporting    conjectures.
