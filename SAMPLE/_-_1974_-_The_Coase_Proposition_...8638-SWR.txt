[ choice  liability  nonliability rule] . . .   pricing system  assured  work without cost" (. 8). Guido Calabresi recently restated  Coase proposition more succinctly  follows: " same allocation  resources  come  regardless     joint cost users  initially charged   cost,   words, regardless  liability rules" (1968, . 67).  course, Calabresi  presumed zero transactions costs.  addition, Calabresi reiterated  Coase conclusion  liability rules   influence  efficient allocation  resources    short  long run.^ major logical problem   Coase proposition   introducing perturbation  otherwise perfect system  then asserting  regardless  legal rules,  system  regain  perfection. Coase,  introducing perturbation, negates    assumptions necessary  asserting   allocation  resources   efficient regardless  liability rules    short  long run, namely perfect information.^
