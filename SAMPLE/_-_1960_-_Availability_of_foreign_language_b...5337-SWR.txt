Few members   American Economic Association apparently know     easily borrow  recent foreign language books  economics.

Un�fortunately  increased internationalization appears   taken place   area  economics.  writings  contemporary foreign economists  arrived  abundance,   cataloged  ready   studied; yet  stand   shelves unread  unexamined.

Except  studies   economies  particu�lar nations (Russia principally)    economists  abroad,  num�ber  articles  contain non-English references  small.    might think  foreign literature   disregarded  some safety    pointed   book reviewers praise  new foreign books generously.  instance,  September 1959 issue   contains sixteen reviews  books  foreign languages (more  one-quarter   total)  almost always commend  volumes  often describe   "contributions,"    article     single foreign�language allusion.
